# Animal Brain Simulator

## Project Goal

Craate a self learning model that can adjust in the field without dramatic forgetting
Use inspiration from nature for learning behaviors and brain architecture

## High level view

The animal brain is constantly learning throughtout the life of the creature.
Early experiences have more effect on the creature.
Brain development/learning:

 1. Brain is growing new neurons throug out creature life
 1. Brain grows new dendrites that connect with other neuron dendrites via synapses
 1. Synapses get stronger if they fire more frequently (repeated actions, fine tuning)
 1. Curiosity drives exploration
 1. Learning is accelerated by:
    1. Positive experiences when happen with joy increase learning (is it result of repetition from joy?)
    1. Negative experiences connected with fear, cause rapid learning of the negative experience

### Notes

Curiosity and fear can be expressed as a measure of novelty

Novelty ranges

  0----bored--and--safe---25---curios----50---curios-scared-but-excited----80----freaked-out----100

bored--and--safe - unguided exploration
curios - focused exploration, once repeated enough
